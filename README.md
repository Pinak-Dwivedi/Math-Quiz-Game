# Math Quiz Game

## Intro

Hello! I am Pinak Dwivedi.

## Description

I have created this project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This is a math quiz game with a very nice, simple, and compelling UI.
There will be a question on the screen with four options, one of which is correct while the other three are incorrect.
The user has to click an option. If they choose the correct option, the UI will update in green, indicating that they made the correct choice. Otherwise, if they choose the wrong option, the UI will update in red, indicating that they made the wrong choice.
Once the user has clicked an option, all the options get disabled. Therefore, the user cannot spam click, and the game provides the user with two different buttons for both the correct and wrong choices.
In the case of the correct choice, there will be a button to move to the next question and a reset game button if they want to start over.
In the event of an incorrect choice, there will be a button to retry the current question once again and a reset game button if they want to start over.
The game also keeps track of the user's score and the highest score of all the games played so far.
